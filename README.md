## Description

_Welcome to my second Epicodus Friday code review. This website welcomes the user and provides an intro that describes what the site will do. The site is designed to take input from the user through a form that has different options. After the user clicks the submit button it will display a computer science track that is offered at Epicodus with a description of the main language._
